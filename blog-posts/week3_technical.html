							<p>Why is JavaScript popular?: JavaScript became popular because Netscape (the first really popular web browser) used a JavaScript engine, prompting the need for Javascript to script for the web.</p>
							<p>JavaScript Advantage:  The biggest advantage to using JavaScript is that it is executed at the client instead of at a web server.  This increases result speed to the client user and preserves bandwidth over the network.   </p>
							<p>JavaScript Disadvantage: Because JavaScript runs on the client side, it also is less secure because it has access to the client's machine while being executed there as opposed to at a distance.  Additionally, JavaSCript may be rendered different by different machines, making it harder to create a universal look and result.</p>
