							<p>I recently came across articles online concerning how the tech world has a sexist culture that may keep women out.  An April 5, 2014 NYTimes article discussed how an app called titstare, depicting pictures of guys staring at breasts, was presented at a prominent hackathon and received with enthusiasm.  This sent a shockwave through much of the tech community, signaling just how sexist the environment had become.  The community should want women to be a part of it.  Many great minds are being dissuaded from joining the field by feeling like they don't belong.  Many consumers of technology are women and their input in the development process could be very helpful.</p>
