							<p>Truth.  This is important because it goes to the essence of so much.  Often, we cannot feel right with ourselves until we are true with ourselves, whether it is in work, righting a lie, or doing what must be done.</p>
							<p>I generally try to live up to this value of truth.  It is like a magnet that pulls toward it.</p>
							<p>The last thing I was asked for advice on most likely dealt with coding in the DBC program.  People often ask for my advice on coding.  This doesn't seem superficially related to truth, but I am sure some relation to an idea of truth can be found if you think about it hard enough.</p>
							<p>Striving for truth and feeling good about it can help you feel better about your struggles if they point toward truth, even if difficult.  Additionally, truth supports treating people the right way and avoiding discrimination.  Knowing you are doing the true and right thing may help you in these difficult situations.</p>
