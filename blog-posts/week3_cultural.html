							<p>My Gregorc style is Abstract Sequential.  This type of learner likes to analyze situations before making a decision and applies logic in solving problems.  While I think these qualities may fit me, I don't know that I fit into this mold perfectly.  Abstract sequential people have difficlty working in groups and repeating tasks.  I think I can do good at both of these.  So, I don't know that my Gregorc style helps that much.  My approach to solving problems often deals with thinking and trial and error, but I also learn well by dealing with others.</p>
							<p>My biggest struggle in phase 0 was due to having to start the program at a later point than others and completing multiple sections in a couple days.  Though it was time-consuming, I was able to do it.  I don't think this has to do with my learning style.</p>
