							<h3>Pairing</h3>
							<p>I enjoy getting to meet and work with others.  However, sometimes it can take a while and often there are connection issues that it make it difficult to communicate.  Overall, though, it can help force a project to get done quickly and help reinforce concepts and learning when I have to explain them out loud.</p>
							<h3>Feedback</h3>
							<p>How did you feel when you read your feedback?
Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?
How was it to write feedback?
What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</p>
<p>I feel OK reading feedback most of the time.  The feedback is mostly positive, but it is a little strange to read writing that doesn't seem like it should be read by me.  I don't think the feedback is usually that helpful, but it is interesting to hear what other people think about our sessions together.  I will try to communicate better when pairing based on the feedback received.  It is ok writing feedback, but I would rather discuss feedback in person.  It is difficult to be critical, but I know sometimes it may help the other person.  When I do need to give critical feedback, I want to do it tactfully.</p>
