							<p style="width:600px">Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.

Shereef's story is nice -- it is nice to hear about how he wanted to help his friend and did something with this philanthropic dream.  I like that the program has grown and that it keeps growing.  Also, I liked that the founder answered questions.
