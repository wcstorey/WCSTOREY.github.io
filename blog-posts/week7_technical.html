							<p>SQL injection occurs when SQL statements are inserted into a database and automatically run when the database is reviewed by a computer.  This may be a problem because executable code causing the loss of data may be hidden inside a large database and remain undetected until too late.  One way to help mitigate the occurance of SQL injection is by automatically escaping characters that have a meaning in SQL, thereby preventing the system from the seeing these characters as having that special meaning and preventing execution of the code. Other methods for mitigation are available, but escaping is one example.</p>
