							<h4>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h4>
							<p>I don't really have many emotional conflicts, so it is hard to think of one.  To make one up, let's say my friend and I fought over some collectible cards when I was a child.</p>
							<h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4>
							<p>My friend wanted the same card that I had.</p>
							<h4>How did you handle that conflict?</h4>
							<p>He yelled and screamed and said he deserved the card, but I had purchased it with the money my grandmother had given me for my birthday.  To make him happy, I allowed him to borrow it for a while, and that resolved the issue.</p>
							<h4>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h4>
							<p>My actions made the situation better.</p>
							<h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>
							<p>I really don't think I even needed to let my friend borrow the card.  What I did was nice, but I am not sure it was necessary.</p>
							<h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>
							<p>I learned that a little bit of kindness can go a long way.</p>
