							<p>I don't know that I have felt hurt by stereotype threat much in my life, but I have heard of minorities experiencing this a little.  For example, I have talked to women that grew up a while ago who felt out of place or very nerdy being intellectual even though they were very smart.  They just never embraced that part of their skillset much because society had not embraced that part of them much.  Instead, they emphasized being pretty or other things.  This saddened me.  I would imagine similar issues may crop up for other stereotyped groups.  At a workplace, I would try to welcome intellect and collaboration from all types of people and celebrate their achievements in any area of life, as we would do for others.</p>
