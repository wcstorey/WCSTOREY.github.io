      <h3>Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?</h3>
      <p>Pair programming is important here at DBC because it is becoming a common practice nowadays in the industry and DBC wants its sutdents student to be prepared to enter the industry.  Additionally, it helps students learn and reinforce the techniques used and better understand the rationale behind using those techniques.  Further, it help develop soft skills for interacting with other developers. </p>

      <h3>Compare Driver &amp; Navigator</h3>
      <p>The driver is the one at the keyboard typing in code listening to the direction of the navigator.  The navigator is not typing, but rather oversees the direction the code is going and directs the driver what he should be programming.</p>

      <h3>Reflections</h3>
      <h4>What was it like to pair for the first time?</h4>
      <p>It was fun.  I enjoy working with others.</p>
      <h4>Did you enjoy it?</h4>
      <p>Yes.  Although, I could likely complete the project faster alone.</p>
      <h4>What worked?</h4>
      <p>I always learn something new by seeing what other developers would do confronted with the same situation.</p>
      <h4>What didn't work?</h4>
      <p>The video connection always seems to be unstable.  Managing connection issues seems to take up a larger percentage of the pairing time than I would like.</p>
